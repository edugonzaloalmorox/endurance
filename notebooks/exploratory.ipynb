      "BAGS: DTF dreams custom handlebar bag, Woolf Tooth b-rad bag, Bedrock bags dropper saddle bag, Osprey Syncro 20L backpack.\n",
      "GEAR HIGHLIGHTS: KLite Ultra Racing Lighting System w/ Bar switch and USB Charge system all powered by my HUNT Dynamo wheels. I am racing to support the Vermont Bicycle Shop flood relief fundraiser, make a donation here. \n",
      "----------------------\n",
      "16: BIKE: I’ll be piloting “Badger,” my singlespeed Why Cycles Wayward all the way to Stateline. Badger is geared 32x22T with an Absolute oval up front and a Problem Solvers SRAM adapter in back. The front wheel is a Mason X Hunt with a SON dynamo hub. The rear wheel is an Industry Nine Hydra. Both sport thick Maxxis Rekon cactus-flingers of the 29×2.6″ variety.\n",
      "BAGS: A much loved Rogue Panda Canelo bar-harness leads the way. Gondola seat pack, custom frame bag, and top-tube bags by Rockgeist. Pronghorn front-roll and feedbags by Revelate Designs. I’ll wear my canyon carry pack – a slightly homespun Osprey Stratos 24L-all the way from MM 103.\n",
      "GEAR HIGHLIGHTS: The dynamo has one job: to juice my Garmin 1040 and a couple of small electronics. I’m leaving the dynamo light at home. Instead, a Fenix PD35 (helmet mounted) paired with a Fenix BC26R (bar mounted) will shine up my nights. A handful of tiny Nitecore 10000mAh power-banks will keep my phone limping along on fumes. I debated several shelter solutions before settling on my Zpaks Altaplex tarp-tent. I can quickly deploy it like a bivy sack to keep the desert crawlers out, while retaining the peace-of-mind that comes with carrying a fully capable shelter. A full length z-rest and Zpaks 20F sleeping bag will keep me cozy during the frigid nights beyond the Mogollon Rim.\n",
      "----------------------\n",
      "17: BIKE: I’ll be riding AZTR300 on a 2021 Yeti SB130 CLR. I opted for my usual SW tire choice of Maxxis Minions with a 2.5″ DHF in the front and a 2.4″ DHRII in the rear, a fresh SRAM Eagle GX mechanical 1×12 drivetrain with a 30T oval chainring, and DT Swiss wheels with an upgraded star ratchet (thanks Guru Bikes!). OneUp handlebars, Industry Nine stem, and a OneUp dropper post round out the build.\n",
      "BAGS: If Miles issues an award for bike bag hacks, I hope this rig is in the running. Custom split frame bag from Rogue Panda, handlebar buckets from Sturdy Bag Designs (Thanks for the custom colors, Joe!), Mag Tank top tube bag, and a frankenroll on the handlebars that’s a mix of a Rockgeist barjam, Oveja Negra cradle, Rockgeist dry bag, and Oveja Negra handlebar pouch to stabilize it all. Custom Sturdy Bag Designs seatpost/jerry can bag. Mix of Revelate Terrapin seatbag and Wayward Riders Louise dropper post saddle bag cradle. Revelate Joey on the downtube to house 2L of water. Not pictured are the Tailfin SFM mounts and 1L Nalgene bottles to add some water carrying capacity for the Gila River section of the AZTR300.\n",
      "GEAR HIGHLIGHTS: I brought a small stove for hot coffee and oatmeal in the morning. That’s my big luxury item for this whole trip. Other highlights include an Outdoor Research Helium Bivy, and a lot of down items that I’ve used bikepacking around the Southwest. I’m also wearing an Osprey mountain biking backpack that will carry 2.5L of water, food, and a few light layers.\n",
      "----------------------\n",
      "18: BIKE: 2022 ToutTerrain Outback 27.5 steel with Pinion P1.18 gearbox and Gates Carbondrive. Cane Creek Helm MKII Air 29″ fork with 130mm travel and Kinekt Active XR suspension seatpost. WTB KOM Tough i40 Rims with Continental CrossKing 27.5 x 2.8″ tires. Satori Falcon Aero handlebar with Ergon GP1 grips. LOOK Trail Grip pedals. This is not a race bike but rather my comfy world traveller.\n",
      "BAGS: Made myself a HF welded framebag from PVC coated PES, my own harness with 3D printed attachments to the handlebar holding an Exped Endura 25 compression bag and my own bag on the handlebar for the 1.5L bladder. Arkel Dry-Lites on Tubus steel rack (15-20 years old). I left a Mammut backpack at a Hotel in Flagstaff when I started biking south to get down to the start.\n",
      "GEAR HIGHLIGHTS: My Pedalcell broke shortly before the trip and the replacement didn’t make it on the plane. I will have to relay on powerbank and a 4-port charger for  electronics and lights. Optimus Polaris stove. Therm-a-Rest Prolite Apex sleeping pad and inflatable pillow, Exped down sleeping bag and Tarptent Moment DW Li Tent. Wahoo Element Bolt and iPhone with MapOut App for navigation. 4l MSR Dromedary to add water capacity. My Gravity Works Filter broke this week, will replace it with a Grayl Geopress, and therefore another heavy and bulky item on my gearlist.\n",
      "----------------------\n",
      "19: BIKE: Soma Juice, Shimano 1×12 (30T chainring), home built wheels (DT Swiss 350s to WTB and Ibis rims) with Maxxis Recon 29×2.4 tires, Fox Float FIT 130mm.\n",
      "BAGS: Bags by Revelate, Nuclear Sunrise, Diday, and Roadrunner.\n",
      "GEAR HIGHLIGHTS: My trusty Brooks B17 saddle and a Mystery Ranch 20L backpack.  \n",
      "----------------------\n",
      "20: BIKE: I’ll be riding a Niner SIR 9 hardtail. This bike has been run over by a truck and is still holding strong—it’s ready for the Arizona Trail! I’ll be using a Maxxis Rekon 2.4″ front tire with an Ikon 2.25″ in the rear. Fox 120mm Step Cast fork. Cane Creek bar ends, Ergon GA3 grips, SRAM GX 32T X 10-52T.

      "GEAR HIGHLIGHTS: I will be wearing a Salomon Active 8 vest and shipping myself a sturdier backpack (repurposed from its school days after some bleach and hand cut foam) along with trail runners and hiking poles, to the South Rim for the Grand Canyon carry. For lighting, I have a Cygolight Ranger 1400 and a Fenix BC26R on my bars and a Serfas 500 on my helmet. Etrex 20 for navigation. My sleep system is an OR helium bivy, with a Therm-a-Rest Neoair and a Katabatic Alsek quilt. I hope to have cozy and restful sleeps! I am likely carrying a small homemade alcohol stove. My dad and I have matching set-ups that have been on several trips together. This time around my dad’s setup (and my dad) will be cheering from home.\n",

      "25: BIKE: Same bike as last year: 2023 Specialized Epic Evo Pro. Increased travel to 130mm from 120mm, cause why not. Fox Factory 34/DPS/Transfer. Specialized Fastrack Grid T7 2.35 F/R.  Shimano XT 12s drivetrain, 30T Wolf Tooth ring, and XT 4P brakes. Custom Nox Farlow Carbon 29er wheels w/DT350 rear and Son 28 Dyno front. Klite Adventure package (light/charger). Last year was eye opening and incredible to say the least…started with the 800 and paired that down to the 300. Doing the 300 again this year and looking to evolve to the 800 in the next year or two.\n",
      "BAGS: Custom Rockgeist Frame Bag, Revelate Salty Roll, Revelate Mag Tank and Mountain Feed Bags. This year I’m trying out the Old Man Mountain Elkhorn rack with their Juniper Trunk bringing up the rear. Osprey Talon 22 backpack.\n",

      "BAGS: I have my sleep kit in a bag that BarYak Joe made for me. I’m using Austere Cams and straps that Joe ordered/sewed for me. All my cheetah print bags are made by Andrew at Dispersed. I’m NOT riding with a seat bag because I just smashed my face into some rocks when my bag sucked into my wheel. The backpack is the Osprey Sirrus 24: the smallest bag I found with a frame (I have an older version that doesn’t hit my helmet while riding.)\n",
      "GEAR HIGHLIGHTS: I’m wearing La Sportiva TX4 approach shoes for the whole thing, including the hike. I still love the AXS Reverb dropper, so I’ll run that for this race. The kLite makes me so happy, so I have a SON hub to power that, but didn’t hook up the charging stuff. Otherwise, the bike is my usual AZT set up.\n",
      "----------------------\n",
      "27: BIKE: Specialized Epic Evo. 30T chainring with SRAM Transmission drivetrain. AXS dropper, 4 piston brakes with metal pads, 180mm rotor up front. Ergon gel saddle to keep the butt happy. Enve M630 wheels with i9 hubs. I’m running 2.4″ 60TPI Rekon Race tires for something a bit lighter and faster rolling. Garmin 1040 Solar for navigation. Fenix BC26R for bar light and Fenix UC35 on helmet. Pearl Izumi X-Alp Summit shoes for all the hike-a-bike and GC portage.\n",
      "BAGS: Bedrock Bags custom frame bag and handlebar roll. Topeak top tube bags, Revelate feedbags.\n",
      "GEAR HIGHLIGHTS: 6L water capacity (3 on bike, 3 on back). I’m really loving the 4 piston brakes. I will be carrying everything for the Grand Canyon hike from the start, so will have a larger pack than normal and will bring hiking poles. Sleep quality and staying warm is a priority this time, so I’ll be cozy in a fluffy 28F bag and air mattress.\n",
      "----------------------\n",
      "28: BIKE: I’ll be riding the 300 on a Soma Juice I’ve put together, originally a parts bin build until I realized how much I like the bike. DT Swiss 110mm fork, 30×22 oval single speed. 29×2.4″ front and 27.5×2.8″ with an I9 single speed hub rear because I’m late to every trend and that’s the only way to fit that big squishy tire in the back. Took note of previous year’s rigs and bought some Rekons.\n",
      "BAGS: Bags are a hodgepodge. Aeroe spider front harness, Swift frame bag, some lovely Revelate stuff. Buckhorn feed bags from when he was located in Albuquerque, and a cheapo top tube bag that’s held up better than I thought it would.\n",
      "GEAR HIGHLIGHTS: The Crank Tank is amazing, such an efficient way to store 3L of water. I’ll be running a small backpack with a 3L hydration bladder as well. Sleeping at least a little, so bringing an inflatable Big Agnes mat and pillow, and an REI flash 1 tent and quilt.  \n",
      "----------------------\n",

Other component highlights include a 30t 5DEV Ti chainring, 22t Boone Technologies Ti cog, Nukeproof Horizon CL pedals, and Paul Component Klampers/Love Levers/Dropper Trigger/Chim Chim bar ends (all with the purple treatment as I am pretty sure purple makes you look faster than other colors).\n",
      "BAGS: BroadFork frame bag (thank you Jacquelyn for the last minute mod to fit the new frame!), Goodday Bikeworks Spacer Cradle front rack with a Revelate Saltyroll, Revelate Shrew seat bag, Take A Trip Snack Pack, Tailfin 1.5-L Flip Top Tube Pack, and an Osprey Syncro 20 backpack for overflow pizza/burritos/beer and the Grand Canyon portage.\n",
      "GEAR HIGHLIGHTS: Dirty Teeth MTB Bikepacking HaB Strap to more easily maneuver the bike over the miles of gnarly hike-a-bike, kLite MTB kit for lighting/charging, Fenix BC26R light & batteries for more lighting, Tailfin SFMs to turn my fork into a mobile water cooler, King Cage Ti bottle and Manything cages (because Ti is a chemist’s best friend), and a picture of my sponsor, Ms. P., with a reminder written on the back that she tells me before every adventure, “Make good decisions.”\n",
      "----------------------\n",
      "30: BIKE: I am most grateful to Roaring all the way on a Salsa Rustler morphed with a set of Bontrager Line pro 30 wheels. I’m running Maxxis Ardent 29x 2.4″ tires up front and Ardent race 2.35″ in rear. XT 1×12 speed soul train at 10-50T with a 30T chainring. Huge thanks to the Greenwood Village REI tech shop for the painstaking build out.\n",

      "GEAR HIGHLIGHTS: Garmin 66i for Nav/C2. A Big Agnes Flycreek 1 (fast fly mode), Therm-a-Rest Ohm 32 degree sleep bag and Nemo UL Tensor for my sleep system. Fenix lights, an Osprey 24L Stratos for the big beautiful Canyon adventure and plenty of Stars and Stripes for inspiration. \n",
      "----------------------\n",
      "31: BIKE: Mainstream 2023 Trek Roscoe. 12-speed Shimano drivetrain mashup. Mismatchy carbon rims laced laced to XT/Onyx hubs. 2.6” Barzo tire rear, 2.6” XR4 front. Shimano XT 4-Piston brakes. Rockshox Pike, 140mm fork.\n",
      "BAGS: All homebrewed aside from a Dispersed rolltop stem bag for more snacks. Ultimate Direction running vest worn with 2-4L of water.\n",
      "GEAR HIGHLIGHTS: Bontrager Verse Short saddle perched atop a 180mm Oneup Dropper, connected to a Wolftooth lever. SQLab 30x 16 deg backswept bars, Ergon GS1 Evo grips, with SQlab inner bar ends to help spread out the burden on the hands.  Fenix BC26r on the handlebars and a Fenix BC21r on the helmet for light. Wahoo Roam v2 for nav, with a couple of 10kmAh Anker banks to power it and my phone/earbuds. 30 deg Sierra Designs sleeping bag paired with a silly Klymit X-frame sleeping pad for a few hours of rest. The real standout though is that whisper-quiet Onyx Vesper rear hub.\n",
      "----------------------\n",
      "32: BIKE: Chumba Yaupon, RockShox SID Ultimate, Maxxis Minion DHF 29×2.5″ tires, Industry Nine/SON hubs on Astral Serpentine rims.\n",
      "BAGS: Frame and top tube bag by Dispersed in leopard print, vintage Rockgeist handlebar sling, Rockgeist Gondola seat pack, old feed bag.\n",
      "GEAR HIGHLIGHTS: Zpacks quilt, Mountain Laurel Designs tarp, Coros Vertix 2 for tracking mileage, Bedrock Mountain Clogs, Attaquer Cargo bibs, Osprey Talon 11 for the Grand Canyon portage.\n",
      "----------------------\n",
      "33: BIKE: This is Charlie. Charlie is a very well-loved Santa Cruz Carbon Chameleon who’s seen a lot of miles. Pictured above on a trip a couple weeks ago in Utah. Build kit is all SRAM XX1 or XO1 components, Reverb Dropper, G2 RSC Brakes, Race Face bar and pedals. NOBL TR 37 Carbon wheels, new this year have been a super solid addition to Charlie this year and are both take the beat down of long loaded rides well and look fun and sparkly provided motivation when I’m exhausted.\n",
      "BAGS: My bags are mostly split these days between custom Rockgeist Bags (thanks Greg) and custom Wolf Pax bags (thanks so much Kya for indulging my ideas). In addition, I’m use my Old Man Mountain Elkhorn rack to make space for all the water I need and deal with the fact that my short inseam doesn’t lend to have a lot of triangle space. Rounding out the kit is a Blue Ice Firecrest 28L pack that will serve as my pack for carrying across the Grand Canyon.\n",
      "GEAR HIGHLIGHTS: The Blue Ice pack I’m using is less that half the weight of many comparable packs and I’m hoping that it’s the ticket for the bike portage and will hold up well since Blue Ice equipment performs so well in rock and alpine environments. The Sea to Summit Spark UL 28 degree sleeping bag has been an asset the last few years and I’m happy to have it with me for 800 miles as well as an Outdoor Research Helium Bivi. This makes for a pretty cozy sleep kit. Fenix lights BC26R are on both my helmet and my bars for all the night riding in the shorter daylight. Overall, nothing too different from the CTR other than making way more space for water and bringing a pack for bike portaging. The crux has been figuring out how to carry everything from the start and have enough power for lighting without having a dynamo.\n",
      "----------------------\n",
      "34: BIKE: I will be spinning 32x22T along the 300 this year on Pinky, my trusty Surly Karate Monkey. Wheels are Profile Elites laced into NOX Farlow rims and wrapped in Vittoria Barzo 29×2.6″ tires. The Fox 34 Step-Cast and Roost Ti bars are there to take the edge off the AZ chunder. Magura Trail brakes to slow down all of the food and water weight I’ll be carrying.\n",
      "BAGS: Frame and top tube bags are from Rogue Panda (shop local!), seat pack is a Rockgeist Foxglove and my handlebar setup is an Oveja Negra Front End Loader with the Lunchbox attachment.\n",
      "GEAR HIGHLIGHTS: Sleeping system will be very minimal, a ground tarp with a Nemo Ultralight Pad and Kelty 20 degree bag (in case I get stuck sleeping on Lemmon). Navigation will be done with a Garmin Edge 530, and I will be carrying an Osprey bag to maximize the amount of water I have. Lights will be (2) Light and Motion Rando 500s that I will cycle through and charge as needed. Cache batteries will keep everything charged since I’m not fast enough to make a dynamo system work properly.\n",
      "----------------------\n",
      "35: BIKE: Chumba Stella Ti SS 34 x 24, i9 wheels, Cane creek Helm 130mm, BarYak cockpit.\n",

      "GEAR HIGHLIGHTS: Going with a Garmin Edge 1040 and Inreach. Excited to also try the Princeton Tech Apex headlamp.\n",
      "----------------------\n",
      "37: BIKE: I’ll be racing the AZT on a 2017 Kona Honzo CR Trail DL, courtesy of my sponsor, Jackson Lester, with a 130mm travel Fox fork and Maxxis Rekon tires (2.6″ front, 2.4″ back) with Exo+ casing. I’ll have a 30T chainring and will be seated on the Ergon SMC Saddle for comfort.\n",
      "BAGS: The highlight of my setup is the puma print bags from Dispersed Bikepacking. The Dispersed bags, designed and built by an elite bikepacking racer, are inspired in a way I haven’t seen from other bag makers. For water and the occasional Grand Canyon crossing, I have the Osprey Sirrius 24L backpack.\n",
      "GEAR HIGHLIGHTS: When it’s time to rest, I’ll rely on an Enlightened Equipment 10 degree quilt, Nemo sleeping pad, and a tyvek tarp, along with an emergency bivvy for when things get weird.\n",
      "----------------------\n",
      "38: BIKE: I’ll be riding AZTR on a 2023 Ibis DV9. The bike features a Shimano Deore 1×11 drivetrain with a 28T One Up Components Switch oval chainring, Shimano XT brakes, Fox 34 fork, DT Swiss x1900 rear wheel and WTB Sti 23 up front a new pair of Maxxis Ardent 2.35” tires, and a PNW Rainier dropper post. For comfort I will be riding a Brooks B17 saddle and Ergon GP2 grips. One other modification is a handlebar extension to hold my electronics.\n",
      "BAGS: I will be using a custom Rogue Panda Designs donut pattern frame bag. I will have a Revelate Designs Salty Roll and two Revelate Designs Mountain Feedbags on my handlebars. My top tube bags are a Revelate Designs Gas Tank and a Rogue Panda Designs Rincon also decked in donuts. My seat bag is also Revelate Designs, I decided to go with a smaller bag with the Shrew.\n",
      "GEAR HIGHLIGHTS: 3L Apidura frame bag bladder, OR Helium Bivy, Garmin GPSMAP 66i for tracking/navigation/emergency beacon. Fenix Lighting PD35 handlebar mounted flashlight.\n",
      "----------------------\n",
      "39: BIKE: Ibis DV9 with a 12-speed 10-51T cassette and 30T AbsoluteBlack oval chainring, Vittoria Mezcal 2.25” tires and a Fox 34 SC fork with 120mm travel.\n",
      "BAGS: Mostly Revelate Designs with a custom frame bag from Rockgeist and a Rogue Panda Canelo handlebar harness.\n",
      "GEAR HIGHLIGHTS: My trusty copilot Danger Duck will be making the ride with me sitting out front on my Bar Yak Ultra alongside my Fenix BC30 front light and Wahoo Roam.\n",
      "----------------------\n",
      "40: BIKE: I’m racing the AZT 300 for the first time (aside from doing it as part of the 750 back in April 2019) on my Revel El Jefe SS, 30×22, Maxxis Rekon tires. I’ll also be carrying a small but heavy backpack which will have 4L of water in it and 2.5 lbs of Tailwind… more on that later.\n",
      "BAGS: Rogue Panda custom framebag, Happy Jack Snack Sacks x2, and custom top tube bag I’ve named the “AlamoGordoLongo,” which is great for those of us who don’t have enough dropper post clearance to run a top tube/seat tube bag.\n",
      "GEAR HIGHLIGHTS: I’m currently not at all heat acclimated as I spent the summer in the North Cascades, where it barely cracked 70 degrees. I got heat exhaustion in Pinyons and Pines back in May for the first time in my life, and I wasn’t able to eat solid food for 12 hours. Since the forecast is for high 90s and it’s been real steamy in Tucson since I got here a week ago, I’m changing up my usual “real food” strategy to make sure I have half my intended calories as liquid. We’ll see how that goes, especially with the limited water sources we have here in the fall after a subpar monsoon season. I’m also pretty new to singlespeeding, I attempted Pinyons and Pines on my SS in May but we all got pulled off the course at around mile 200 due to death mud. Hoping to make it a bit farther this time… ideally the entire 300 miles! I’m gearing a bit easier than I did last time, and I think I might try flat pedals even though I suck at them, since singlespeeders get off more. But I also might change my mind last minute.\n",
      "----------------------\n",
      "41: BIKE: I will be riding a Specialized Epic Evo with a 130mm Fox 34 on the front. I will be running Shimano XTR 1×12 with a 30T chainring.\n",
      "BAGS: I have custom bags from Morrow Packs, a Bedrock Bags Moab Handlebar bag, and an Apidura downtube bag.\n",
      "GEAR HIGHLIGHTS: I will be using an Osprey Stratos backpack for the Grand Canyon portage and a Patagonia Dirt Roamer Pack for the rest of the trip. \n",
      "----------------------\n",
      "42: BIKE: ‘ilo’ is a Ti Solace Cycles OM-2P. It rolls on DT Swiss EX511 wheels with drilled schrader valves and DT Swiss 350 hubs. The boots are Schwalbe Wicked Will 2.4’s. The drivetrain is a Pinion C1.12 with a Gates Belt. A PNW dropper post, Cane Creek bar ends, and 120mm Rock Shox Sid Ultimate keep things comfortable during the rowdy bits. Sinewave Cycles Beacon v2 to light the way via cache batteries. SLX 4-piston brakes keep the descents under control.\n",
      "BAGS: Shaka Packs custom cotton duck frame bag. Rockgeist custom XL top tube bag. Salsa EXP cradle up front. GONEX feed bags. Not pictured is a 24L Osprey Manta hiking pack with a 3L bladder.\n",
      "GEAR HIGHLIGHTS: The Pinion and Gates combo is ridiculous. Riding 800-miles with a loaded hiking pack will be interesting. Folding hiking poles and my Shimano AM903 shoes should help me conquer the Grand Canyon in comfort. Water capacity is 8L.\n",
      "----------------------\n",
      "43: BIKE: Oddity Single Speed, 32x23T. The build consists of Paul Klampers, Ignite Cranks and Ring, KickA$#Cog, Wolftooth grips and pedals, Berd wheels, Kenda tires and a Garmin 1040.\n",
      "BAGS: Jpaks in all the right places plus a Tribulus Endover front bag for those longer sections between re-supplies.\n",
      "GEAR HIGHLIGHTS: I love everything about this bike, but items of note would be Jpaks bags due to the fit and shear usability and organization they provide. The Oddity frame is otherworldly from a ride comfort standpoint. I’m currently obsessed with my Paul Klampers as well. I’ve got 7.5L of water carrying capacity, including 2.5L in my pack.\n",
      "----------------------\n",
      "44: BIKE: I’ll be riding the AZT300 on a 2019 Rocky Mountain Instinct Carbon 70. The bike is mostly stock with a few minor modifications: new tires (Maxxis Minion DHF 2.5 on the front and Maxxis Minion DHR 2.3 on the rear), a 30T chain ring (stock was 32T) and a new X01 rear derailleur (stock was GX). Other features of the bike include a Fox 34 Performance Elite 140mm fork and a Fox Float DPS EVOL Performance Elite 140mm rear shock. Both the fork and the rear shock are fully lockable. Pedals are Time ATAC.\n",
      "BAGS: All bags are from Revelate Designs. Most were purchased back when the company name was Epic.\n",
      "GEAR HIGHLIGHTS: My luxury item is a Sea To Summit Soloist tent. It adds a bit of weight but is well worth it when the weather turns ugly. I’ll also have a Montbell Hugger down bag and a Therm-a-Rest NeoAir XLite to complete my sleep system. I’ll also be carrying an eTrex Vista HCX for navigation. Lighting includes a Princeton Tec Apex on my helmet, a Serfas SL-255 on my bar and a planet bike rear flasher.\n",
      "----------------------\n",
      "45: BIKE: I’ll be riding my Specialized Epic Evo on the AZT 300. Hoping my SRAM AXS batteries last, and my Fox StepCast fork provide me enough squish to make my ride smooth! I’m running Ground Control tires with the Grid casing mounted on my trustworthy Industry Nine Trail 280 wheels.\n",
      "BAGS: I’ve got an awesome custom teal frame bag from Greg over at Rockgeist and also running the Rockgeist top tube bag and Gondola seat bag. I love the super solid Revelate Pronghorn harness and dry bag combo so I’m sticking with that on the front.\n",
      "GEAR HIGHLIGHTS: I’ll be taking my MLD bivy and a sleeping bag liner to keep me (barely) warm at night and enough food to get me halfway to the finish. I’ve got a BeFree water filter and iodine as a backup and trusting my Garmin Etrex 32x for navigation.\n",
      "----------------------\n",
      "46: BIKE: Making a second attempt at the AZTR 300, this time on a 2023, Ibis Ripley. The rubber up front is 2.4″ Maxxis Dissector, and in the rear a 2.4″ Maxxis Minion DHR II.  Drivetrain is 1×12 with a 28T Oval chainring. A OneUp carbon bar and SQLabs seat and grips were added to dampen some of the trail chatter.\n",
      "BAGS: The upper and lower frame bags and downtube bag are all from Rogue Panda. The Gas tank is from Rockgeist, the seat-pack from Roswheel, and the handle bar bag from RockBros. I’ll carry up to a total of 5.5 L of water, spread across a 2.5 L in an Osprey backpack, an additional 2 L on the handle bars, and another 1 L in the  lower frame bag. Shelter is provided by an Outdoor Research Helium Bivy and a REI Igneo 25 F bag.\n",
      "GEAR HIGHLIGHTS: The revving sound made when my rear tire grinds against my seat-pack, it sounds like I’m going much faster than I am.\n",
      "----------------------\n",
      "47: BIKE: I will be racing the 300 on a 2020 YT Jeffsy Pro with 27.5×2.4″ maxxis rekons. The bike is pretty stock with some recent drivetrain upgrades and Ergon saddle/grips. The Baryak handlebar rack has been a great addition for my front roll and cockpit organization.\n",
      "BAGS: I have a mix of bags. I’m stoked on my new Dispersed bikepacking top tube bags. I also have a feed bag, saddle bag, and dry bag prorector from Rockgeist. Revelate Designs feed bag and downtube bag for my cold soak jar/food. I’ll be running a 10L dry bag on my bars and two bottle holders on my forks to keep me hydrated. One wedge bag that I made with recycled dyneema Fanny packs.\n",
      "GEAR HIGHLIGHTS: Will be wearing a USWE hydration pack for extra water and my hydration packets. Shelter is a tarp and borah gear bivvy. Sleep kit is a Sea to Summit mummy bag and Gossamer gear thin light pad. Garmin Edge 840 Solar for navigation and Fenix bike light/Nitecore headlamp to light my way. \n",
      "----------------------\n",

      "BAGS: I’m running Dispersed bikepacking bags made by my partner Andrew and me in our van/half-finished workshop in Utah. I’m also carrying a backpack with hiking poles from the start to survive the Grand Canyon portage.\n",
      "GEAR HIGHLIGHTS: I chose Wolf Tooth Waveform pedals and hiking shoes for this hike-a-bike heavy route. I’m using the Garmin inReach Mini 2 for tracking and Edge 1040 Solar for navigation.

The Sea to Summit Spark UL 28 degree sleeping bag has been an asset the last few years and I’m happy to have it with me for 800 miles as well as an Outdoor Research Helium Bivi. This makes for a pretty cozy sleep kit. Fenix lights BC26R are on both my helmet and my bars for all the night riding in the shorter daylight. Overall, nothing too different from the CTR other than making way more space for water and bringing a pack for bike portaging. The crux has been figuring out how to carry everything from the start and have enough power for lighting without having a dynamo.', 'Sleeping system will be very minimal, a ground tarp with a Nemo Ultralight Pad and Kelty 20 degree bag (in case I get stuck sleeping on Lemmon).

Since the forecast is for high 90s and it’s been real steamy in Tucson since I got here a week ago, I’m changing up my usual “real food” strategy to make sure I have half my intended calories as liquid. We’ll see how that goes, especially with the limited water sources we have here in the fall after a subpar monsoon season. I’m also pretty new to singlespeeding, I attempted Pinyons and Pines on my SS in May but we all got pulled off the course at around mile 200 due to death mud. Hoping to make it a bit farther this time… ideally the entire 300 miles! I’m gearing a bit easier than I did last time, and I think I might try flat pedals even though I suck at them, since singlespeeders get off more. But I also might change my mind last minute.', 'I will be using an Osprey Stratos backpack for the Grand Canyon portage and a Patagonia Dirt Roamer Pack for the rest of the trip.', 'The Pinion and Gates combo is ridiculous.

My repair kit consists of a OneUp EDC pump and multitool, Dynaplugs, and a few other odds and ends, none of which I hope to actually use. Shoutout to Voile Straps, which I count 12 of on my rig.', 'I’ll be using a custom cuben fiber sleepsak with a Sea to Summit Spark bag for those moments of rest, while the Fenix BC30 bar light and BCR26R head light will keep me riding after the sun goes down.
