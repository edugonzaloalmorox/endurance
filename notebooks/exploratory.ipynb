His sarcasm will often get the better of him. He quite literally feared the idea of riding a bike on the rural roads where he grew up in Ontario. It wasn’t until a bike became a means of transportation was he turned on to the idea of riding further from civilization. Miles’ relocation to Powell River, British Columbia has opened up even more opportunities for big rides, fizzy water sampling, and the chance to enjoy some of the most beautiful terrain in the Pacific Northwest. He’s been known to tackle projects (with wit) that are thrown at him and looks forward to contributing to the industry as much as he can.

      "\t<p>The Arizona Trail Race is an unofficial challenge that takes place every year on the Arizona Trail, which snakes its way across the state. Two distances are available: the Arizona Trail 300 is a 300-mile event that has been held every April since 2006, and the Arizona Trail 800 is the complete traverse from Mexico to Utah, which was was offered for the first time in 2010 as the AZTR750. Both events are run concurrently, and for 2023, they start at the same location and same time on the Arizona/Mexico border. As if the riding wasn’t challenging enough, the AZT800 riders must carry their bikes 21 miles across the Grand Canyon, as bikes aren’t allowed on that section of the route.</p>\n",
      "<p>Perhaps the most exciting story is that there are <a href=\"https://bikepacking.com/news/2023-womens-triple-crown/\">five women</a> going after the Triple Crown, with the 2023 Arizona Trail Race as the final piece of the puzzle. For those unaware, the Triple Crown of bikepacking is awarded to riders who complete the Tour Divide, Colorado Trail, and Arizona Trail Race in a single season. Be sure to keep an eye out for Lael Wilcox, Katya Rakhmatulina, Alexandera Houchin, Hannah Simon, and Kristen Tonsager. Additionally, Jefe Branham and Alexandera Houchin set new singlespeed records on the 800-mile route last year, so we’ll be watching the one-geared riders closely too. </p>\n",
      "<p>As always, with the help of event organizer John Schilling and the riders, we gathered a list of 40 rigs, each accompanied by the name, age, hometown, and a brief kit list for each rider. Check them all out below, then head over to the <a href=\"https://bikepacking.com/tracker/2023aztr/\">event tracker to follow along live</a> and find the updates we’ll be posting during the event. But first, here’s a quick rundown of the 2023 Arizona Trail Race route, as there are a few noteworthy changes this year.</p>\n",
      "<h3>The 2023 Arizona Trail Race Route</h3>\n",
      "<p><em>by John Schilling</em></p>\n",
      "<p>The 2023 edition of the AZTR is hopefully going to see less vegetation encroaching the trail due to a lighter monsoon season. However, the heat will be a factor over the first week of riding as summer doesn’t quite want to let go. On the route, there are notable changes for both the 300 and 800. The first is the addition of the Casa Blanca Canyons Passage of the Arizona Trail near Patagonia. Formerly known as Temporal Gulch, there is now a complete ribbon of singletrack through the Santa Rita Mountain foothills (outside of the wilderness boundary).</p>\n",
      "<p>Up on Mt. Lemmon, there are major changes to the routes. The 800 riders will mostly push their bikes up the official AZT Wilderness Bypass route, dubbed the Lemmon Pusch (Pusch Ridge Wilderness). At the top of Lemmon, the AZT has been officially moved off upper Oracle Ridge in favor of Red Ridge and Catalina Camp trails linking back to Oracle Ridge at Dan Saddle. Farther up the route, the 800 riders will find more singletrack near Sunflower, a vastly improved Highline Trail as part of a restoration initiative and a small reroute on the North Rim. One possible detour is still in effect near Blue Ridge on the Mogollon Rim due to a prescribed burn in the area. Keep those dots refreshed! </p>\n",

Badger is geared 32x22T with an Absolute oval up front and a Problem Solvers SRAM adapter in back. The front wheel is a Mason X Hunt with a SON dynamo hub. The rear wheel is an Industry Nine Hydra. Both sport thick Maxxis Rekon cactus-flingers of the 29×2.6″ variety.<br>\n",
      "<strong class=\"font-sans-bold\" style=\"font-size:.9em;\">BAGS</strong>: A much loved Rogue Panda Canelo bar-harness leads the way. Gondola seat pack, custom frame bag, and top-tube bags by Rockgeist. Pronghorn front-roll and feedbags by Revelate Designs. I’ll wear my canyon carry pack – a slightly homespun Osprey Stratos 24L-all the way from MM 103.<br>\n",
      "<strong class=\"font-sans-bold\" style=\"font-size:.9em;\">GEAR HIGHLIGHTS</strong>: The dynamo has one job: to juice my Garmin 1040 and a couple of small electronics. I’m leaving the dynamo light at home. Instead, a Fenix PD35 (helmet mounted) paired with a Fenix BC26R (bar mounted) will shine up my nights. A handful of tiny Nitecore 10000mAh power-banks will keep my phone limping along on fumes. I debated several shelter solutions before settling on my Zpaks Altaplex tarp-tent. I can quickly deploy it like a bivy sack to keep the desert crawlers out, while retaining the peace-of-mind that comes with carrying a fully capable shelter. A full length z-rest and Zpaks 20F sleeping bag will keep me cozy during the frigid nights beyond the Mogollon Rim.</p>\n",

      "<p><strong class=\"font-sans-bold\" style=\"font-size:.9em;\">BIKE</strong>: Same bike as last year: 2023 Specialized Epic Evo Pro. Increased travel to 130mm from 120mm, cause why not. Fox Factory 34/DPS/Transfer. Specialized Fastrack Grid T7 2.35 F/R.  Shimano XT 12s drivetrain, 30T Wolf Tooth ring, and XT 4P brakes. Custom Nox Farlow Carbon 29er wheels w/DT350 rear and Son 28 Dyno front. Klite Adventure package (light/charger). Last year was eye opening and incredible to say the least…started with the 800 and paired that down to the 300. Doing the 300 again this year and looking to evolve to the 800 in the next year or two.<br>\n",
      "<strong class=\"font-sans-bold\" style=\"font-size:.9em;\">BAGS</strong>: Custom Rockgeist Frame Bag, Revelate Salty Roll, Revelate Mag Tank and Mountain Feed Bags.

I’m using Austere Cams and straps that Joe ordered/sewed for me. All my cheetah print bags are made by Andrew at Dispersed. I’m NOT riding with a seat bag because I just smashed my face into some rocks when my bag sucked into my wheel.

      "<strong class=\"font-sans-bold\" style=\"font-size:.9em;\">GEAR HIGHLIGHTS</strong>: The Crank Tank is amazing, such an efficient way to store 3L of water. I’ll be running a small backpack with a 3L hydration bladder as well. Sleeping at least a little, so bringing an inflatable Big Agnes mat and pillow, and an REI flash 1 tent and quilt.  </p>\n",

      "<strong class=\"font-sans-bold\" style=\"font-size:.9em;\">GEAR HIGHLIGHTS</strong>: The Blue Ice pack I’m using is less that half the weight of many comparable packs and I’m hoping that it’s the ticket for the bike portage and will hold up well since Blue Ice equipment performs so well in rock and alpine environments. The Sea to Summit Spark UL 28 degree sleeping bag has been an asset the last few years and I’m happy to have it with me for 800 miles as well as an Outdoor Research Helium Bivi. This makes for a pretty cozy sleep kit. Fenix lights BC26R are on both my helmet and my bars for all the night riding in the shorter daylight. Overall, nothing too different from the CTR other than making way more space for water and bringing a pack for bike portaging. The crux has been figuring out how to carry everything from the start and have enough power for lighting without having a dynamo.</p>\n",

Since the forecast is for high 90s and it’s been real steamy in Tucson since I got here a week ago, I’m changing up my usual “real food” strategy to make sure I have half my intended calories as liquid. We’ll see how that goes, especially with the limited water sources we have here in the fall after a subpar monsoon season. I’m also pretty new to singlespeeding, I attempted Pinyons and Pines on my SS in May but we all got pulled off the course at around mile 200 due to death mud. Hoping to make it a bit farther this time… ideally the entire 300 miles! I’m gearing a bit easier than I did last time, and I think I might try flat pedals even though I suck at them, since singlespeeders get off more. But I also might change my mind last minute.</p>\n",

      "GEAR HIGHLIGHTS: We built in a switch so that I can either charge the powerbank or power up the lights using the dynamo and plug 5 usb charger.\n",

      "GEAR HIGHLIGHTS: It’s either the full custom Albannach kit made by Endura, or the Straight Cut frame bag to fit an Apidura 3l frame bladder (to keep me hydrated and to keep the weight off my back) or all the ingenious thingmejigs that Dr Jon cooks up – @drj0n_bagworks DeWidget, Double Dangler, Barnacles, GFunks and Strap Deck. This setup is more painfully Scottish than a whisky fuelled hangover cured only by a haggis + tattle scone roll washed down with IrnBru. \n",

      "GEAR HIGHLIGHTS: The Supernova M99 B54 front light is epic. It offers such a wide beam and so much visibility even on the super low modes. Battery lasts forever (or at least two full nights on mid-mode, which should see me through Badlands without a recharge…).\n",
      "----------------------\n",
      "29: BIKE: BenBen race edition steel frame, GRX brakes and derailleur, 34/10-42T gearing, Ibis 928 rims, DT Swiss 240S hubs, Pirelli Cinturato Hard 45mm with cush core tubeless setup, Ritchey WCS VentureMax XL 520 mm Handlebar, Ergon CF Allroad Pro Carbon seatpost, Infinity saddle, Profile Design aero bar, Wolf Tooth double bottle adapter, Garmin Etrex 32x.\n",

      "GEAR HIGHLIGHTS: Klymit Intertia X frame sleeping pad. Light weight and comfortable. X-Bionic Trail Run Effektor shirt. I´ve used it in both the Arizona Trail Race and Silk Road Mountain Race and its ability to regulate body temperature is unrivaled in my opinion.\n",
      "----------------------\n",
      "30: BIKE: I’ll be riding Badlands on my Custom painted Cervélo Aspero. It has been painted to the colour scheme of my KASK PaulSmith helmet. My drivetrain is Rival SRAM Etap with a 10-44T cassette in the back. Zipp 303s wheels with Schwalbe G-One RS 44mm wide tires. I might still mount a Schwalbe G-One R 45mm wide in the front for a little more grip in the turns. The cockpit has an Easton stem and handlebar with a Deda Parabolica Due timetrial bar. As a little detail I have Grey aluminium bottle cages from Seido.\n",
      "BAGS: My bags are from 2 differtent brands. The AGU saddle- and framebag I’ve had for a few years now. They are perfect. The toptube bag is my latest purchase. It is a Restrap long toptube bag for the easy accessible stuff, including food, tubeless plugs, and battery packs.\n",

      "GEAR HIGHLIGHTS: I switched the 42T ring to go to a 38T. In the back, I installed a Garbaruk long derailleur cage to be able to ride a 11/50T Sunrace cassette. With this set up, I should be able to climb trees (I hope). During a trip in Australia, I bought a Crank Tank 3L specifically for the badlands, as hydration is key.\n",
      "----------------------\n",
      "33: BIKE: 51 Assassin – Sram Force/ Eagle mix. 38T x 10-52T. Schwalbe G-One RS 40mm and borrowed wheels.\n",
      "BAGS: Apidura top tube/ frame pack and sale bag.\n",
      "GEAR HIGHLIGHTS: The highlight is the 51 but if the rear derailleur and bottom bracket arrive before the race they will be the real game changers.\n",
      "----------------------\n",
      "34: BIKE: I’ll be riding my Canyon Grizl again. This time with aerobars and a 2x GRX setup with 48/34T front rings and a 11-46T cassette. Tires will probably be Pirelli gravel M in 45mm. I’m using a Lupine Piko front light with two 6.9AH batteries.\n",

      "----------------------\n",
      "35: BIKE: I’ll be riding the Pastel gravel bike, made in Salzburg. The bike features a fresh pair of Pirelli Cinturato Gravel M tires 700x45mm, a 40T front chainring and a 10-52T SRAM Eagle cassette in the back. The front wheel features a SON dynamo hub connected to a kLite front light.\n",

      "36: BIKE: I’ll be riding my Orbea Terra equipped with a Shimano GRX Di2 groupset featuring 46/30T chainrings and a 34-11T cassette. For wheels, I’ll have the Hunt 48 limitless carbon wheels fitted with tubeless Renéherse 48mm Oracle Ridge on the front and 44mm Manastash Ridge on the rear. I’ll be using profile aerobars with 70mm risers for comfort not speed. I hope to find my way during the night aided by a Ravemen PR 2400 along with an Exposure Zenith Mk2 mounted on my helmet. The Wahoo Roam will serve as my GPS.\n",
      "BAGS: I’ll have a Salsa cradle holding an Ortlieb drybag (10l) with my sleeping kit and extra clothes, Apidura racing framebag (4l) for tools, spares, and electronics, as well as an Apidura racing saddlebag (7l) for clothing and food.

      "GEAR HIGHLIGHTS: My Macgyver-style DIY mount positioned between the aerobars to hold the Ravemen light. I’m also a big fan of the Wolf Tooth supple bar tape.\n",
      "----------------------\n",
      "37: BIKE: For this epic adventure I am riding a Trek Checkpoint ALR5, with a Wolf Tooth Goatlink to accommodate an 11-42T cassette and 46/32T crank. To deal with the ever-changing terrain the bike is equipped with 45mm Pirelli Centauro Gravel M Classic tires.\n",
      "BAGS: As far as bags go, on the back I am carrying a tailfin aeropack with some food, collapsable water bottles, an extra kit, a down jacket, and some small extra ‘just-in-case’ stuff. On the frame, I have two Apidura bags that carry electronics, lights, daily food, tools, and mechanical ‘knick-knacks’. I am also carrying a food pouch from Zéfal with plenty of space for snacks and to hold the garbage. On the handlebar, I am taking an Ortlieb bag which is responsible for keeping the sleeping system compact and dry.\n",
      "GEAR HIGHLIGHTS: The note on the stem reminding me that “pAiN is just a French word for bread”. \n",
      "----------------------\n",
      "38: BIKE: Racing in a pair, we are both riding the Enough Cycling custom painted Basso Palta of our Collective. Our bikes will be running on Pirelli Cinturato Gravel RC 40mm tyres mounted on Fulcrum Rapid Red Carbon wheels. Campagnolo Ekar is the groupset of choice, in its 38/10-44T version for adventure racing. We complete our setup with a Fizik Argo 00 adaptive saddle and Crank Brothers Candy pedals. Elite is providing the bottle cages (Prism model) and the Enough custom bottles.\n",
      "BAGS: We will use a light setup from our trusted friends at Miss Grape, bringing an Internode 4.10 frame bag, a big node top tube bag and Cluster 7L bag under our saddle.\n",
      "GEAR HIGHLIGHTS: Our aim is to enjoy the ride and spend a great time together: we’ll bring our music speaker and a daddy cam to ducument our ride!\n",
      "----------------------\n",
      "39: BIKE: The bike is a Giant Revolt Advance 2 with GRX 600 gears and DT SWISS GR 1600 wheels. The tires are WTB Venture TCS 50mm. On the handlebars, there is a Garmin Edge 540 and an Exposure MaXx-D MK13.\n",
      "BAGS: The top tube bags and the frame bag are all from Apidura. The front two are from their racing collection, both stuffed with carb mixes. The rear top tube bag is from their backcountry collection, that has all my repair stuff. On the seat post, there is a Tailfin 3L Downtube, where all my sleeping gear is stored.\n",
      "GEAR HIGHLIGHTS: On my back, I’ll be carrying a Camelback Chase backpack. In the backpack, I’ll have a water bladder, some spare clothes, and some real food. \n",
      "----------------------\n",
      "40: BIKE: Giant Revolt Advanced Pro 0, 2×11 GRX Shimano Groupset, 31/48 chainrings, and the cassette is an 11-42 XT with a Wolftooth so it works a little better, but it is possible without a Wolftooth. Tyres are Pirelli Cinturato Gravel M 45’s. Wheels are Giant’s own CRX2.\n",
      "BAGS: Apidura 1L top tube bag, Apidura 9L saddle bag, AGU 3L frame bag, with Uswe 2L hydration pack.\n",
      "GEAR HIGHLIGHTS: No fancy kit, Bib shorts are Ciovita Apex Cargo from South Africa, very nice shorts. I have packed a rain jacket for rain (doh), and for colder temperatures, I have a down jacket from Mac in a Sac and also brought arm warmers and leg warmers.\n",
      "----------------------\n",
      "41: BIKE: Brother Cycles Kepler frame, Profile Design Sonic Ergo Aerobar T5 with 3D printed bridges, GRX 600 1×11 speed groupset, KMC gold chain, Restrap/Apidura bags, DT swiss E1800 wheels, Garmin edge 1300 plus, Lezyne 1300 XXL front light, hutchinson touareg 40mm, SR Allroad Core Pro saddle.\n",

      "GEAR HIGHLIGHTS: The gold chain gives me a power bonus.\n",
      "----------------------\n",
      "42: BIKE: I am riding our FiftyOne Assassin. Badlands was the inspiration / validation for this bike during its design process so its a great honour to participate in the event that helped create it. Shimano GRX 800 Mechanical with a modified gear range of 31 x 46 to hopefully keep the legs moving even in the most difficult sections. ENVE carbon stem and seat post. Easton AX 50 AX Handlebar. Profile Design Tri Bars, Zipp 303 wheel set with SON dynamo hub feeding a Supernova light and Wahoo Roam. Challenge Getaway XP 45mm tyres. Arundel cages. Enduro threaded T47 BB. WTB SL8 Saddle. I’ll be riding the bike in the long rear chip position and the low front setting. This maximizes the wheelbase and gives me more stability on the front end.\n",
      "BAGS: Tailfin carbon AeroPack With Apidura top tube pack and handlebar bag.\n",
      "GEAR HIGHLIGHTS: I’ve chosen a 2X set up as it allows me to keep a great chain line at all times. The 31 x 46T is hopefully overkill but was fun to set up and achieved with the use of a drop out extender. Some subtle Badlands themed artwork to finish it off. \n",
      "----------------------\n",
      "43: BIKE: I will be riding Badlands on a Pinarello Grevil  with a Shimano GRX groupset.\n",

      "BAGS: Bags are a bit of a mix: AGU (Saddle & Frame), Restrap (Top Tube & Aero Bar)\n",

      "BAGS: Lifeline frame and top tube bags, Podsacs handlebar bag and hydration backpack with 2L bladder.\n",
      "GEAR HIGHLIGHTS: I’m keen to try my new Fenix HMR65R headlamp. I’ll be cycling as light as possible with only a small bivvy bag, sleep pad and my trusted inflatable pillow. A down jacket, merino base layer, rain jacket and the usual leg and arm warmers.\n",
      "----------------------\n",
      "47: BIKE: OPEN WIDE, Zipp 303 wheels, Shimano GRX Di2, Garbaruk 42T 11-50T.\n",

      "GEAR HIGHLIGHTS: Sleeping system: emergency bivy, comfort item: inflatable pillow.\n",
      "----------------------\n",
      "48: BIKE: I’m riding my lovely Dropbar Exceed. A build I did last winter based on the frame of a Canyon Exceed XC Race Hardtail. Converted it to drop bars, equipped a hybrid “Sramimano” group consisting of Shimano crank set, chain and cassette (36 x 10-51), SRAM Eagle AXS GX RD and Rival brifters and brakes. A RockShox SID SL Ultimate provides just the right amount of squish and bling at the front while being utmost light and avoiding cable mess via the lockout lever (I’ll want to use very rarely anyways) on the crown. Tires are Continental RaceKing ProTection 29 x 2.2″ on Newmen wheels. For Badlands I decided to go without a dynamo hub and will use just a Lupine Neo as main light. Profile Design aerobars on a Neosonic Bracket complete my cockpit.\n",
      "BAGS: I’m a big fan of the Tailfin Aeropack. On the top tube I have the middle sized flip-top Top Tube Pack from Tailfin. Below my aerobars I use the cyclite Handle Bar Aero Bag and I accompany it with one of their new super minimalistic food pouches. Hydration and a bit more place for food will be covered by a Camelbak Chase Vest. It’s 1.5L bladder will be used in conjunction with the 2 x 750 ml bottles in the frame, a possible bottle in the food pouch and another one below the down tube (still pondering whether just via a bottle cage or my 1.7L Tailfin Downtube Pack.\n",
      "GEAR HIGHLIGHTS: My bike, really. I have a gravel bike, too. And I love it. But the truth is: Where I live, where I ride and where I travel to ride there’s hardly nicely curated gravel. It’s XC MTB terrain. Basically any gravel is, it’s just a degree of your comfort level and what you consider to be fun. My Dropbar Exceed is soo much fun for just such terrain. And it rolls fast over good roads, too.\n",
      "----------------------\n",
      "49: BIKE: I’ll be riding a BMC URS01 One. It has a SRAM Red/XX1 groupset 38T / 52-10T, an ENVE carbon rim in the back and a custom build Nextie carbon front wheel with SON dynamo hub. I will ride Schwalbe G-One R tubeless tires 40mm. My light is a Supernova M99 DY Pro. It is super bright and will hopefully help me through the desert nights. My aerobars are a kind of custom build setup with parts of my recent triathlon bike. Comfort is more important to me than aerodynamics.\n",
      "BAGS: My bags are from Cyclite, a small German company. The bags are super lightweight and yet durably and super cool looking. I use their top tube bag (food, powebank), a small frame bag (food, spares, tools) a small 8L saddle bag (inflatable mattress, bivy bag, first aid kit, clothes) and a food pouch. All bags total only 470g. For an additional 2L water supply I will wear a Cyclite race backpack with a 2L water bladder.\n",
      "GEAR HIGHLIGHTS: I asked my 9-year-old son what he likes best about my setup. He said, “the purple color!”\n",
      "----------------------\n",
      "50: BIKE: I’ll be racing my 3T Exploro Ultra (named JamJelly) for the 2023 edition of Badlands. The bike is equipped with a SRAM eTap AXS Mullet build with a 38T chainring and 10-52 cassette. I have a Kogel Kolossos for those marginal (maximal over the long term) gains. I’m running the HUNT 25 Carbon Gravel Race Wheelset with Schwalbe G-ONE RS tires, 45c front, 40c rear. I have a 25oz Bivo bottle, two 22oz bottles, and a 1.5L Apidura Frame Pack Hydration Bladder that puts me at 3.5L of water on the bike.\n",
      "BAGS: I’ll be running a full Apidura Racing setup with the 7L Racing Saddle Pack carrying a lightweight down jacket, a Velocio Wind vest, knee warmers and arm warmers for the night time, extra Velocio Utility bibs, an extra pair of socks, Tailwind drink mix, and extra food. My 4L Racing Frame Pack has the 1.5L Hydration Bladder, tools, spares, and a first aid kit. The 1L Racing Bolt-On Top Tube Pack has the ultralight external battery Nitecore NB10000, all cables, euro plug with USB ports, electrolyte + caffeine pills, and CBD cream for the hot foot woes. Bars and gummies will be stored in the Apidura 1.2L Plus Backcountry Food Pouch. Lastly, I have the cheeky little 7L Packable Musette Bag that sneaks in behind my frame pack to carry all the snacks I lack room for in my bags and pockets after a resupply stop.\n",
      "GEAR HIGHLIGHTS: My favorite items include the Apidura Packable Musette Bag for extra food + h20 after store stops and the Fenix HM65R light that lasts forever. I will carry a 1.5L Hydra flux soft reusable bottle to put into the musette bag. Last year I carried a 1L plastic bottle in the bag for the long stretches on course without water and it irritated my back. \n",
      "----------------------\n",

      "GEAR HIGHLIGHTS: The Terra “in frame” locker (underneath the removable front bottle cage) is great for storing some of the heavier tools for puncture and bike repairs in the frame -and low on the centre of gravity for the bike. Wheels and tyres are essential to get through this kind of race in one piece and I love the bombproof Alta and Cintuaro combination. I also love the rear Restrap bag – it doesn’t look that big but I can fit so much in there. My approach for the race has definitely been to travel light, but err on the side of caution when it comes to bike mechanicals. Still I have managed to pack a sleeping mat (TRINORDIC Ultralight 500g), sleeping sack, great lights (Moon Meteor X Auto front, KNOG spare front) and power banks, and a very tiny wash kit.\n",

It’s a full carbon, short wheel-based ripper but for this year I decided to size up to a 56 and add the RockShox Rudy to make the bike a bit more stable and compliant. The bigger size also makes more space for cargo inside the triangle.
